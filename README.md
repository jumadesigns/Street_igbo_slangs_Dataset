# Naija Street Slang Dataset Project
Welcome to the Naija Street Slangs Dataset (NSSD) project! This is an open-source initiative aimed at collecting, curating, and expanding a dataset of Nigerian street street slangs and their meanings and application. 

## Goal

My goal is to build and train models that can understand and generate a typical Naija (Nigerian) street slang, a vital part of the Nigerian street culture and everyday communication.

## How You Can Contribute
We believe that everyone, regardless of coding knowledge, can contribute to this project! Whether you're a native speaker of Igbo, a language enthusiast, or someone who just loves slang, we welcome your input. Here’s how you can contribute:

### Add New Slangs
If you know a street Igbo slang that's not already in the dataset, feel free to add it! We accept slangs with their meanings and usage examples.

### Verify Existing Slangs
Help us ensure the accuracy of the dataset by reviewing slangs that others have added. You can suggest corrections or improvements if needed.

### Suggest New Categories
If you think there are categories (like 'Greetings', 'Insults', 'Compliments', etc.) that need to be included, let us know!

## How to Contribute (No Coding Required)

For those who don't know how to code or use GitHub, we’ve made it super simple for you to contribute:

### Option 1: Use the Online Form (Easy Way)
We’ve set up an easy-to-use Google Form where you can submit new slangs or update existing ones. Just fill in the slang, its meaning, and a usage example, and we’ll add it to the dataset!

[Submit your slang via this Google Form link](your-google-form-link)

### Option 2: Create an Issue on GitHub (Intermediate Way)
If you're a developer, interested in learning or familiar with GitHub, you can open an issue and tell me the slang you want to add. I’ll take care of the rest!

### Option 3: Pull Requests (Advanced Way)
If you’re a developer, you can clone the repo and directly add slangs to the JSON dataset. Submit a pull request, and we’ll review and merge it.

## Dataset Format

The dataset is stored in a simple and structured JSON format. Each slang entry contains the following fields:

- **Slang**: The term in street Igbo.
- **Meaning**: A brief description or translation of the slang.
- **Example Usage**: A sentence showing how the slang is used.
- **Category**: The type of slang (e.g., Greetings, Insults, etc.)

We use this format to keep the dataset easy to understand and process for training machine learning models.
